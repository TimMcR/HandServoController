# HandServoController
This is the code to control an animatronic hand with Arduino
The hand can be controlled by a single Arduino Uno on the hand that plays out commands
Or it can be controlled by a glove with flex sensors and an Arduino Nano with NRF control to make the hand imitate a person's hand
As of right now the glove to control the hand has not been finished, however the code to run the hand without it i working perfectly
